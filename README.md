# The Unofficial Daisy Bloom Header File

This header file is intended to allow development on the Daisy versions of the Qu-Bit Bloom. It is not supported by Qu-Bit Electronix, but rather is a community effort to turn the Bloom into a platform for development. 

Note, there are two versions of the Bloom. Please see [this page](https://www.qubitelectronix.com/bloom_differences) to figure out which one you have. **This file only applies to the Daisy Version of the Bloom.**
